 support multiple users. This means that, while the program is executing, the user can choose to switch his account and enter the username of a different user. Each user will have a different history that will be available when the user is logged in.
• The new version will support two types of users: Admin and Player. The admin user will only be allowed to do administration tasks (i.e. access the administration menu) while the player will only be allowed to see his/her information as well as being able to start quizzes. The player will not have access to the administration menu unless he switches his account to an admin account. The admin will not be allowed to start a quiz unless he switches his account to a player account.
• A login page, where the user enters his username and password. Based on the entered details, the user role will be identified, and a related main menu will be displayed.
• A player ‘main menu page’ available for the ‘Player’ user.
• An admin ‘main menu page’ available for the ‘Admin’ user.
• Different types of questions should now be supported, new question types are:
o MCQ Question: Same as in V1.0
o True or False Question
o Complete question
• While adding a new question or loading questions from file, you will need to check if the added questions are duplicated or not.
• The code should be implemented with OOP concepts. This means that,
o At least, the following classes and their relationships are expected to be implemented in the delivered code (you can add more classes/relations if you need to). If you have another suggested design for the classes that you think will be easier or more efficient
